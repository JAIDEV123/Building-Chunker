# Building-Chunker
A revamped version of the Building Chunker Experiment hosted by IIIT-H for VLABS (a Govt. of India Initiative)

Chunking is an analysis of a sentence which identifies the constituents (noun groups, verbs, verb groups, etc.) which are correlated. These are non-overlapping regions of text.

*The objective of the experiment is to know the importance of selecting proper features for training a model and size of training corpus in learning how to do chunking.*

## Getting Started

 1. Python
 2. Flask
 3. Linux System is preferred for testing

### Installation

## Testing

The setup for a flask application is pretty simple. Just run the following command:

python3 main.py

This should start a web server at localhost:5000/ Type this link into your broswer's URL field in order to view the application.
