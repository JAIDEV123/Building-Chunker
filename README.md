# Building-Chunker
A revamped version of the Building Chunker Experiment hosted by IIIT-H for VLABS (a Govt. of India Initiative)

Chunking is an analysis of a sentence which identifies the constituents (noun groups, verbs, verb groups, etc.) which are correlated. These are non-overlapping regions of text.

The objective of the experiment is to know the importance of selecting proper features for training a model and size of training corpus in learning how to do chunking.
